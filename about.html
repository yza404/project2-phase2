					<h2>Designer</h2>

					<p>
						Evelyne Chetrite remembers the vivid colors of her childhood in Morocco, those which contrasted with the ochre earth of the villages and the simple yet elegant white caftans worn by her mother. She also remembers the piles of shirts, impeccably crafted by her grandfather in his Rabat shop. It was here that her love of clothing was born. Her move to Paris during her teenage years confirmed this initial enthusiasm, and her vocation began taking root in the streets of Paris.
	She studied law but sharpened her fashion mind at weekends, working at vintage shops where she formed a circle of loyal buyers who loved her selections. When she met Didier Chetrite, he gave her the opportunity she needed to call upon her talents as a stylist. The couple embarked on their Sandro adventure together in 1984, and their first boutique was opened on rue Vieille du Temple in the heart of the Marais. They enjoyed instant success.
	Her vision of femininity is the basis for her designs; she focuses on her favorite area of expression, the masculine-feminine equation, and shares an indisputable Parisian elegance with those she dresses. Evelyne designs unambiguous clothes to worn by an urban girl who hones a discreet look, only to be all the more visible for it. Her appeal is nurtured with an almost innate balance and gives her a naturally cool appearance. Evelyne is open to new ideas and inspiration - as long as she remains faithful to herself.
